  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>{error}</p>;
  if (data) return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.extract}</p>
    </div>
  );

  return null;
};
```

##### Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useWikipediaData } from './useWikipediaData';

const WikipediaSummary = ({ topic }) => {
  const { data, error, loading } = useWikipediaData(topic);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>{error}</p>;
  if (data) return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.title}</h1>
      <p>{data.extract}</p>
    </div>
  );

  return <p>No data available.</p>;
};

export default WikipediaSummary;
```

##### Notes

- The hook uses the Wikipedia REST API to fetch the summary of a given topic.
- It manages the loading state, error state, and the fetched data state internally using React's [`useState`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fmenokoog%2Fdevelopment%2Fpractice-apps%2Fshogun-g%2Fsrc%2Fhooks%2FuseWikipediaData.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%2C%22304b6dae-d4d8-4e23-8180-28669df279be%22%5D "Go to definition") and [`useEffect`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fmenokoog%2Fdevelopment%2Fpractice-apps%2Fshogun-g%2Fsrc%2Fhooks%2FuseWikipediaData.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%7D%5D%2C%22304b6dae-d4d8-4e23-8180-28669df279be%22%5D "Go to definition") hooks.
- Ensure that the [`topic`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Fmenokoog%2Fdevelopment%2Fpractice-apps%2Fshogun-g%2Fsrc%2Fhooks%2FuseWikipediaData.js%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A33%7D%7D%5D%2C%22304b6dae-d4d8-4e23-8180-28669df279be%22%5D "Go to definition") parameter is a valid string to avoid unnecessary API calls.
